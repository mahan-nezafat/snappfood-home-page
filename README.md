# snappfood-home-page
snapfood.ir responsive home page with HTML, Sass, Bootstrap, Js

# description 
this project was created with HTML, Css, Sass, Bootstrap, Javascript. this was my first time to work with Bootstrap and Sass and using them in a project
so I tried to impelement modular coding with Sass and learned to do nesting and mixin and also tried to work with Bootstrap classes for making a responsive
layout and to not apply the same properties to elements also the project has vertical newbar for showing products and it is fully responsive for smaller
screens
